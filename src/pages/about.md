My name is Aishwarya Manoharan, Grad Student from San Jose State University, California with a Master degree in Software Engineering.

I love back-end dev, but dabble in front-end sometimes, too. Earlier I enjoy working at Infosys.

When I’m not working, I fool around with Photoshop, watch movies, play badminton, cook and eat a lot, practice Spanish.

It brings joy to my heart that you’ve read this far, so here is a joke for you: Why are mountains so funny? Because they're hill areas.
